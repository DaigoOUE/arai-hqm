### what is quantum mechanics?
- structure of a material  
  atom and molecule > atomic nucleus > ...
- newtonian (classical) mechanics cannot be applied in the small world.
  - black body radiation  
  energy non-equipartition between atoms and radiation at equilibrium
  - discrete orbits of an electron
- quantum mechanics: neither a particle nor a wave
  - de Broglie wave
  $$
  E=\hbar\omega,
  \quad
  p=\hbar k
  $$
  - photoelectric effect
