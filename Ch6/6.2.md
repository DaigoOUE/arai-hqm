### basic concepts in quantum mechanics: states and physical quantities
- classical (Hamilton) mechanics
  - DoF: the number of independent variables that determines the configuration of a system in question,
  e.g.~DoF of a paticle in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is 3.
  The configuration is determined by the coordinates $q=(q\_1,q\_2,q\_3)$.
  - motion of a system is determined by the coordinates and momenta $p=(p\_1, p\_2,\cdots,p\_f)$ which is conjugate to the coordinates.
